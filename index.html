    <p>I am a student at Eagle Rock High School as of the 2023-2024 school year. I have been working in different areas of development for the majority of my life.</p>
    <p>This portfolio aims to show my progression from creative writing to game development.</p>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>I have always had an interest in Creative Writing. Since I was in elementary school, I have spent much of my free time writing stories, writing ranging from a paragraph to full biographies.</p>
